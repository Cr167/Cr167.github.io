        <h1>Travel to Mount Rainier!!!</h1>
        <p>A mountain of amazing peace, Seattle, Washington houses Mount Ranier. In a glimpse Mount Ranierâ€™s nature is truly extraordinary, valleys of flowers and forests of trees. People have been enjoying this wonderful place for 9000 years.  Many like John Muir and other historic people have been greatly inspired.  260 miles of hiking trails featuring amazing scenic views. Your family is sure to grow closer during the visit. <p>
        <h2>Vistor Info</h2>
        <p>There are many stunning things to do at Mount Ranier, but I recommend taking the gondola ride, it is full of sights right out of a story tale. But the best part is that it is 10 minutes. There is also train ride through important and historic scenes. Although fall and summer are great times to visit Mount Ranier, spring and winter is a finer choice. Backpacking into Mount Ranier is a very popular thing and is a super fun environment to explore. The Wonderland Trail is 93 miles and is a highly strenuous trail but is totally worth it. The Ohanapecosh area is a good camping area, for it has dozens of trees and other special features. There are many snow activities like skiing and sledding. The Longmire Museum is action packed local history, area information, gift shop and has picnic tables and restrooms.<p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>There are many alpine mountains in the Pacific Ring of Fire. But did you know that by far Mount Ranier is the largest mountain in the Pacific Ring of Fire? For instance, Mount Ranier is the highest peak in the beautiful Cascade Range. Mount Ranier houses many glaciers most of them 750 feet deep. There are many inspiring trails filled with nature and a bundle of amazing views. The mountain even holds a world record! It is the world's largest volcanic glacier cave. The mountain would be expected to be rock and only rock but surprisingly 58% is forested, 23% is subalpine, and the remainder is alpine. <p>
